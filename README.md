**NOTE:** 
1. This lesson & assignment [README](README.md) is _intentionally_ blank, to be used as your notebook for study and discussion. _It is a great aid for your study and the main component of your submission._
2. Read and follow the [lesson-and-assignment](lesson-and-assignment.md).
3. For this assignment, readability, clarity, and proper formatting are required. Refer to the lesson-and-assignment document for examples, and the [Github markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). The cheat sheet doesn't exhaust all you can do with markdown in a Github README.md. If you need more sophisticated elements, search on Google and/or ask the course staff.
