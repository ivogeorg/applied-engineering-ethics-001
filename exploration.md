## Exploration 001: General Ethics

### 1. Study

The domain of ethics is vast, but its most important dimension of variation is whether it is more theoretical or more applied. The theoretical aspects of ethics are inextricable from the domain of [philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/). Ethics is one of the fundamental questions in philosophy, so we will only take a quick look, and not dive into it. The [applied](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/) side is more interesting to us because it gives us concrete things to do to make things better. Interestingly enough, the Aristotle's [Nichomachean Ethics](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8438), considered the foundational work in Western Ethics, is expressly applied!

### 2. Apply

1. Make a search on "ethics" at the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/). You will see page upon page of results on various kinds of ethics. _What is the most generic definition of **ethics** that you can find in the encyclopedia? What are three (3) domains of ethics that are the most novel and striking to you?_
2. Read the [Introduction](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/e/ethics/about-aristotles-ethics) to Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. _Where does Aristotle lay the burden of responsibility for ethical behavior?_

### 3. Present

In the [Study & Discussion](README.md):

1. Write a paragraph each answering the two questions in 1.2.1.
2. Write a paragraph answering the question in 1.2.2.
